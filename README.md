# Real-time multi-camera 3D human pose estimation on edge devices

In this workspace I leave the implementation of the code used in my thesis "Real-time multi-camera 3D human pose estimation on edge devices". Tests are made using a newtork of raspberry pi 5.

## Requirements:

    - ros2 jazzy
    - libtensorflow_lite, to be installed in "/usr/lib" with include files in "/usr/include/tensorflow"
    - cv_bridge
    - opencv4
    - eigen
